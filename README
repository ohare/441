Notes:
    My program runs very slowly so I have reduced the number of blocks per file.
    I would liked to have spent more time fixing this.

Design:
    Master.c: starts worker and disc threads and initialises 
        shared memory variables
    Worker.c: for L iterations calls read and write methods,
        these would have been implemented as threads if I had the time.
        Read and write send messages to a queue which I have implemented
        as a circular buffer.
    Disc.c: checks to see if queues are non-empty if they are then
        it gets the monitor from the queue and processes the request
        (Pretends to read from the disk to the buffer). One it has
        processed the request it puts a new monitor into a worker
        queue and sets a condition to let the worker know to read
        the completion time from the monitor in that queue.


Cheers,
